## Security Considerations

- **Testnet Only**: This system operates on XRPL testnet for development/testing
- **Seed Management**: Wallet seeds are entered manually; implement secure storage for production
- **Transaction Verification**: Always verify transaction hashes on XRPL explorer
- **File Security**: Receipt files are uploaded to public IPFS; ensure no sensitive data

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create new modules in the `xrpl_txs/` directory
2. Import and integrate in `main.py`
3. Follow existing patterns for XRPL client usage
4. Include proper error handling and user feedback

### Testing

- Use XRPL testnet for all transactions
- Obtain test XRP from the testnet faucet
- Verify all transactions on the testnet explorer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Trustline Creation Fails**
- Ensure wallet has sufficient XRP for transaction fees
- Check if trustline already exists

**NFT Minting Fails**
- Verify Pinata API credentials
- Ensure file path is correct and accessible
- Check wallet has enough XRP for fees

**Payment Failures**
- Verify recipient wallet addresses
- Ensure sufficient balance for amount + fees
- Check network connectivity

### Transaction Explorer

All transactions can be viewed on the XRPL testnet explorer:
`https://testnet.xrpl.org/transactions/{transaction_hash}`
